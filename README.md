API Based GIF Find and Display

# Giphy Assignment: University of Denver Coding Bootcamp
Sixth homework assignment.

# Sitcom Giphy King
Styled webpage for viewing GIFs obtained using API data from giphy.com. Upon page load buttons with sitcom titles are created. Pressing on a button initiates a search for that sitcom title at giphy.com and obtains API data for 10 GIFs. GIFs that are rated higher that 'PG' (e.g., PG-13 or R) are removed and the remaining GIFs populate within the page. GIFs load as still images, clicking on any image plays the GIF and clicking on the animated GIF stops the animation. The user can search for GIFs from another sitcom by entering the sitcom title in the search input text box and clicking on the search button. Upon doing so, a new button with the sitcom title is created. Clicking on that button will obtain GIFs as described above for the other buttons.
